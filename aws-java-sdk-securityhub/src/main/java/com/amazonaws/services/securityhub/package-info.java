/**
 * <p>
 * Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security state of your AWS environment and resources. It
 * also provides you with the compliance status of your environment based on CIS AWS Foundations compliance checks.
 * Security Hub collects security data from AWS accounts, services, and integrated third-party products and helps you
 * analyze security trends in your environment to identify the highest priority security issues. For more information
 * about Security Hub, see the <i> <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html">AWS Security Hub User
 * Guide</a> </i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are executed only in the AWS Region that is currently
 * active or in the specific AWS Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration or settings change that
 * results from the operation is applied only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions, execute the same
 * command for each Region to apply the change to. For example, if your Region is set to <code>us-west-2</code>, when
 * you use <code>CreateMembers</code> to add a member account to Security Hub, the association of the member account
 * with the master account is created only in the us-west-2 Region. Security Hub must be enabled for the member account
 * in the same Region that the invite was sent from.

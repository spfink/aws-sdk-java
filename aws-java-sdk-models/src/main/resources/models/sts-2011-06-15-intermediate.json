This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For more detailed information about using this service, go to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html\">Temporary Security Credentials</a>. </p> <p>For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, go to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html\">Signing AWS API Requests</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. For general information about the Query API, go to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html\">Making Query Requests</a> in <i>Using IAM</i>.

Global requests map to the US East (N. Virginia) region. AWS recommends using Regional AWS STS endpoints instead of the global endpoint to reduce latency, build in redundancy, and increase session token validity. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html\">Managing AWS STS in an AWS Region</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Most AWS Regions are enabled for operations in all AWS services by default. Those Regions are automatically activated for use with AWS STS. Some Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), must be manually enabled. To learn more about enabling and disabling AWS Regions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html\">Managing AWS Regions</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. When you enable these AWS Regions, they are automatically activated for use with AWS STS. You cannot activate the STS endpoint for a Region that is disabled. Tokens that are valid in all AWS Regions are longer than tokens that are valid in Regions that are enabled by default. Changing this setting might affect existing systems where you temporarily store tokens. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html#sts-regions-manage-tokens\">Managing Global Endpoint Session Tokens</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>After you activate a Region for use with AWS STS, you can direct AWS STS API calls to that Region. AWS STS recommends that you provide both the Region and endpoint when you make calls to a Regional endpoint. You can provide the Region alone for manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong). In this case, the calls are directed to the STS Regional endpoint. However, if you provide the Region alone for Regions enabled by default, the calls are directed to the global endpoint of <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>.</p> <p>To view the list of AWS STS endpoints and whether they are active by default, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html#id_credentials_temp_enable-regions_writing_code\">Writing Code to Use AWS STS Regions</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Recording API requests</b> </p> <p>STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were successfully made to STS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on.</p> <p>If you activate AWS STS endpoints in Regions other than the default global endpoint, then you must also turn on CloudTrail logging in those Regions. This is necessary to record any AWS STS API calls that are made in those Regions. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/aggregating_logs_regions_turn_on_ct.html\">Turning On CloudTrail in Additional Regions</a> in the <i>AWS CloudTrail User Guide</i>.</p> <p>AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a global service with a single endpoint at <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>. Calls to this endpoint are logged as calls to a global service. However, because this endpoint is physically located in the US East (N. Virginia) Region, your logs list <code>us-east-1</code> as the event Region. CloudTrail does not write these logs to the US East (Ohio) Region unless you choose to include global service logs in that Region. CloudTrail writes calls to all Regional endpoints to their respective Regions. For example, calls to sts.us-east-2.amazonaws.com are published to the US East (Ohio) Region and calls to sts.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com are published to the EU (Frankfurt) Region.</p> <p>To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html\">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>",

You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call <code>AssumeRole</code>.</p> </important> <p>For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account. Then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html\">IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session\">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html\">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: You cannot call the AWS STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies shouldn't exceed 2048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. </p> <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a different account).</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to assume the role. For more information about trust policies and resource-based policies, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html\">IAM Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.</p> <p> <code>\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p> <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters.

Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term AWS credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS service API operations.</p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session\">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html\">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies shouldn't exceed 2048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, you must have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the application can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the role's trust policy. </p> <important> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your AWS CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the <a href=\"http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims\">Subject</a> of the provided Web Identity Token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field.

The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies shouldn't exceed 2048 characters.</p> <p>Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. The only exception is when the credentials are used to access a resource that has a resource-based policy that specifically references the federated user session in the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy. When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user.

Typically, you use <code>GetSessionToken</code> if you want to use MFA to protect programmatic calls to specific AWS API operations like Amazon EC2 <code>StopInstances</code>. MFA-enabled IAM users would need to call <code>GetSessionToken</code> and submit an MFA code that is associated with their MFA device. Using the temporary security credentials that are returned from the call, IAM users can then make programmatic calls to API operations that require MFA authentication. If you do not supply a correct MFA code, then the API returns an access denied error. For a comparison of <code>GetSessionToken</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The <code>GetSessionToken</code> operation must be called by using the long-term AWS security credentials of the AWS account root user or an IAM user.

/**
 * <p>
 * Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the following data sources:
 * VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs. It uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious
 * IPs and domains, and machine learning to identify unexpected and potentially unauthorized and malicious activity
 * within your AWS environment. This can include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or
 * communication with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains. For example, GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2 instances
 * serving malware or mining bitcoin. It also monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of compromise, such as
 * unauthorized infrastructure deployments, like instances deployed in a region that has never been used, or unusual API
 * calls, like a password policy change to reduce password strength. GuardDuty informs you of the status of your AWS
 * environment by producing security findings that you can view in the GuardDuty console or through Amazon CloudWatch
 * events. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html">
 * Amazon GuardDuty User Guide</a>.
